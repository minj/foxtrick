# Hints:
# translate the right side of the = sign.
# the left side are idenitifiers for internal foxtrick use. leave them unchanged.
# sentences starting with # are comments. leave them unchanged

# Text with %-sign eg %s will be automatically replaced by the appropriate text.
# Eg in "The price is %s." %s will be replaced by the selected amount of money.
# Thus, you need to include those %s entries into your text accordingly
