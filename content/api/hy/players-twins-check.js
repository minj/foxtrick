 *		avatars:
 *			urlencoded version of youthavatars chpp file v1.0
 *		isHyUser (0/1) (optional):
 *			used to simulate HY users or non-HY users for debugging purposes
 *			if not present HY will find out the correct value itself
 *			if set to 1
 *			@response players[id].marked and
 *			@response players[id].non will not be present for non HT users.

 * @response
 *		JSON:
 *			isHyUser (true / false) (deprecated)
 *				the user is using HY already
 *			userID
 *				integer HY userID, -1 if not a user
 *			players: (dictionary)
 *				list of players
 *				non: number of possible twins marked as non-twin (not present if isHyUser = false)
 *				marked: number of possible twins marked as twin (not present if isHyUser = false)
 *				possible: total number of possible twins
 *			fetchTime (deprecated)
 *				Unix timestamp of the fetched information in seconds
 *			lifeTime (deprecated)
 *				LifeTime of the information in seconds, avoid further requests until
 *				fetchTime+lifeTime is met, new pulls to the youth team are a valid reason
